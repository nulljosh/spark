## Rejection fixes 2026-08-03 (production was broken, not just the binary)

Sparkjar was REJECTED on both platforms. Investigating the "unable to sign up or
sign in" report turned up **four stacked production bugs**, none of which were the
originally-suspected cause:

1. **`useSupabase()` destructured a property that does not exist** (`api/_lib/store.js`).
   It read `const { url, key } = getSupabaseConfig()`, but that returns
   `{ url, anonKey, serviceRoleKey }`. `key` was always `undefined`, so `useSupabase()`
   always returned false and **every auth path skipped Supabase** for the `/tmp` store.
   On Vercel `/tmp` is per-instance and ephemeral, so accounts were created and then
   did not exist on the next request. This was THE root cause. Fixed in `4787840`.
2. **`SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` each carried a trailing literal `\n`**
   (two characters, from being set with `echo` rather than `printf`). `String.trim()`
   does not strip those, so the URL failed DNS and the key was rejected as invalid.
   Both re-added with `printf`; `cleanEnv()` in `api/_lib/supabase.js` now strips them
   defensively so a recurrence self-heals. Self-check: `node api/_lib/supabase.selfcheck.js`.
3. **Unapplied migration** — `posts` was missing the `date`/`time` columns that
   `LIST_COLUMNS` selects, so every feed read threw `column posts.date does not exist`
   and fell back to 12 hardcoded seed posts. Applied `20260613000008_add_date_time_fields`.
4. **Writes used the anon key against RLS that only admits `authenticated`.**
   `createUser` (plus `setResetToken`/`clearResetToken`/`updatePassword`), the posts
   INSERT and the comments INSERT all lacked `useServiceRole: true`. `createUser` also
   omitted `user_id`, which is NOT NULL with no default. The GitHub and Apple paths
   already did this correctly; the email/password path was the outlier.

Verified end-to-end against production after the fixes: register -> persists in
Postgres, login -> returns the correct `user-...` id, post -> row lands in `posts`.
Feed now serves 45 real rows instead of 12 seeds.

Also fixed: **1.5 Support URL** — ASC pointed at the site root (the marketing page),
and `/support` was the SPA served through the `vercel.json` catch-all. Added a real
static `support.html` (same pattern as `tos.html`, which bypasses the rewrite) and
repointed both platforms. **5.2.5** — the Mac app displayed as "SparkMac"; "Mac" in a
display name is an Apple trademark violation. Set `CFBundleDisplayName`/`PRODUCT_NAME`
to `Sparkjar` in `macos/project.yml`, leaving scheme/target/bundle ID alone.

### Still to do
- [ ] Rebuild + resubmit BOTH platforms. The reviewed builds (iOS `202607191845`,
      macOS build 3) predate the dead-host fix, so new binaries are required even
      though the server side is now correct.
- [ ] Note for the next session: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` could not be read back
      (Vercel marks it sensitive) so it was not re-added with `printf`. If service-role
      writes ever fail, suspect the same trailing `\n` — `cleanEnv()` should already
      neutralise it, but re-adding it cleanly is the certain fix.

## Blocked on Joshua

Two mechanical steps, both ~1 minute. **No Apple Developer portal work is required** — the
earlier note demanding a Services ID, a `.p8` key, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_KEY_ID` and a
`APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY` was wrong and has been deleted. Native Sign in with Apple only needs
Apple's *public* JWKS to verify a token, and the `APPLE_ID_AUTH` capability was already
added headlessly to bundle ID `T8XK2M54GG` (`com.heyitsmejosh.spark`) on 2026-08-03.

- [ ] **Then rebuild and resubmit.** The capability change **invalidates the existing
  provisioning profile** — regenerate it (`asc profiles`) before archiving, and verify the
  built app with `codesign -d --entitlements :- <path>.app`: it must show both
  `com.apple.developer.applesignin` and `application-identifier`. A missing
  `application-identifier` is what made Uprighty's builds TestFlight-ineligible (ITMS-90886).

Future, not needed now: revoking Apple tokens on account deletion (Apple requires it for
apps offering account deletion, which `api/_lib/auth/delete-account.js` does) is the one
thing that would later need a `.p8` key and the client_secret JWT exchange. Not built.

## Fixed 2026-08-03 — dead hostname (partial fix for the 2.1(a) rejection)

Root cause of the reviewer's "sign up returns an error" and "app displays a server error": every native client hardcoded `https://spark.heyitsmejosh.com`, which is **dead** (curl returns 000/no response). `https://sparkjar.heyitsmejosh.com` returns 200. Repointed all 10 occurrences across `ios/`, `macos/`, `watchos/`, `widgets-ios/`, `widgets-macos/`, and the `api/_lib/auth/github*.js` SITE_URL fallbacks.

Endpoint verification against the new host: `/api/auth/login` 400 on empty body (alive, validating), `/api/auth/register` 400 (alive), `/api/posts` 200 GET / 401 POST (alive). `/api/auth/apple` 501 (the stub above).

Bundle-ID rename (`com.heyitsmejosh.spark` → `sparkjar`) deliberately NOT done here — still a separate coordinated change.

### Dead-hostname sweep results (2026-08-04) — all 7 findings FIXED 2026-08-04

Method note for whoever repeats this: `~/Documents/Code` is **itself a git repo**, so every child repo is gitignored and a plain `rg`/`grep -r` from that directory silently returns almost nothing (17 hits, all from the two top-level docs). `--no-ignore` is required — with it the same sweep returns 40 distinct hostnames. The original "not swept this pass" note likely hit exactly this.

All 40 `*.heyitsmejosh.com` hostnames curled. Dead (`000`, no DNS): `books`, `brief`, `charters`, `curvely`, `dose`, `lingo`, `monica`, `oldname`, `school`, `spark`, `tally`, `vxgd`, `yourapp`. Also `abraham` → 404, `uprighty` → 404, `life` → 403 (archived on purpose). Everything else 200.

**Correction to an existing note:** `voxprint.heyitsmejosh.com` now returns **200**, not `000`. The voxprint roadmap's "does not resolve, decide whether the domain follows the rename" item is out of date — the subdomain is live, so that decision may already be made. Re-check before acting on it.

Real bugs, ranked:

Not bugs, listed so they don't get re-flagged: `lexly/vercel.json:3` redirects *from* `lingo.` (a redirect source doesn't need to resolve — harmless, arguably should stay); `talli/src/api.js:340` lists both `talli.` and `tally.` in a CORS allowlist (extra entry, no effect); `journal/_site/**` hits are generated build output inside historical posts.

## App Store submission checklist (consolidated 2026-08-06)
- [ ] Rebuild + resubmit BOTH platforms — reviewed builds (iOS `202607191845`, macOS build 3) predate the production-bug fixes above, new binaries required. See "Blocked on Joshua" above for the Sign in with Apple provisioning-profile regen this also needs.

## From Apple Notes (imported 2026-08-08)
- [ ] **"TestFlight icon looks super old" — not a bug, expected staleness.** Checked via `asc builds list`: the latest uploaded iOS build (`8d32852e…`, version `202607191845`) was uploaded 2026-07-19T18:47. The app icon (`ios/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon.png`) was last regenerated in commit `613a87b` on 2026-08-03 — 2 weeks *after* that build. No build has been uploaded since the icon fix, so TestFlight/ASC is correctly showing the icon that shipped in the last real upload — this is covered by the existing "Rebuild + resubmit BOTH platforms" item above, not a separate bug.
- [ ] Screenshots: only 1 of 4 iOS screenshots exist (`screenshots/ios/01-feed-6.7.png`) — no fastlane/Snapfile or asc-shots-pipeline wired up for this repo yet, needs setup from scratch.
- [ ] Landing page + registration/onboarding flow.
